## Great! How do I get started?
You are looking at a *Git* repository on *GitHub*. You need to get (pun intended) a copy of this repository on your computer. [Follow the instructions here.](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

Now that you have Git installed, it's time to "clone" this reponsitory. Click the green "Clone or download" button on this page and copy the link it shows you. If you don't already have your terminal open, open the Terminal app (if on a Mac) or the Git Bash app (if on Windows). At your terminal, type `git clone ` and paste in the link you just coppied, then press enter. The full command will look like `git clone git@github.com:devgr/how-to-web-dev.git`. 

Next, it will be helpful to install a code editor so that you can easily view and edit these files. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can also use other editors, but Visual Studio Code has lots of features and is easy to get started with.

### Opening this repo in an editor
When you cloned this repository above, a folder/directory was created on your computer with these files. Here's how to find out where on your computer those are located. At your terminal, type `cd how-to-web-dev` and hit enter, then type `pwd` (if on a Mac) or `cd` (if on Windows) and hit enter. It will tell you where you are located on your drive.

Open Visual Studio Code, installed above, or the editor of your choice. Click "Open folder..." and navigate to the location that you found above, then click open. You should now see the files in this repository inside of your editor.
