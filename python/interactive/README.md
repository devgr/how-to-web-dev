# Interactive Python Console
One of the coolest features of Python is the ability to use the language without having to write a code file and run it. Instead:

At the terminal, do `python3`. You should see some info, and then a `>>>` prompt. Try typing `2 + 2` then hitting enter. Neat, right? Try `a = 42`, then just `a`. You'll see that it tells you the value of the variable. You can use the variable, for example `a / 2`. You can do any Python expression in the interactive console that you can do in a code file.

To exit the interactive console, do `quit()` and hit enter.

In future tutorials, feel free to try the code in the interactive console, or putting the code in a file and running it.

So far you have mostly worked with numbers. Next, you'll learn strings of text.
